# PyBer_Analysis

OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS

	The purpose of this project is to perform an analysis of PyBer ride sharing data and categorize it by city type. Using two csv files provided by the company, the goal is to analyze the data and determine the fares for each city type. The goal is to make sure that Pyber is provided top notch service to rural, suburban, and urban areas.

THE RESULTS

		All Rides	All Drivers	All Fares	Average Fare per Ride	Average Fare per Driver
Rural	            125	           78	        $4,327.93	       $34.62	                $55.49
Suburban	    625	           490	        $19,356.33	       $30.97	                $39.50
Urban	           1,625	  2,405	        $39,854.38	       $24.53	                $16.57 

	After completing a thorough analysis of the data I have created an overview and summary.
	
		1. Urban cities have the highest amount of riders, which also concludes to those cities have the most profit.
		2. Urban cities have over 1,900 more drivers than Suburban, which show the high demand for drivers in Urban cities.
		3. The average fare per driver is much higher in Rural cities compared to Urban cities ($55.49 to $16.57). This shows that Rural riders are traveling further distances than urban riders.
		4. From the data set, it shows that Urban cities accounted for 68% all rides.




RECOMMENDATIONS

		1. I would recommend analyzing the Rural city data further to determine to distances of the rides. This can limit your drivers in those area and they wouldn't bring in more fares than those that work in the Urban cities.
		2. This could possibly result in needing more drivers in the Rural cities to meet the demand for long distance rides.
		3. A possible solution is to decrease the number of drivers in the Urban areas. A re-structure of your driver groups might be beneficial.
			a. Urban cities had 2,405 drivers compared to 1,625 rides. That's 780 drivers without a ride.
			b. Suburban cities had 490 drivers compared to 625 rides. 135 drivers had at least two rides.
			c. Rural cities had 78 drivers compared to 125 rides. 47 drivers had at least two rides.
